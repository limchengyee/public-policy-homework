# SQLite3 Installation Instructions for Windows/cygwin

* Download the 64-bit installer/updater [setup-x86_53.exe](https://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe) and open it.
* Click through the first setup window (Cygwin Setup).
* "Choose Installation Type" → "Install from Internet."
* "Choose Installation Directory" → find your original install's directory.
* "Select Local Package Directory" → again, whatever you'd like, but the Downloads default is good.
* "Select Connection Type" → "Direct Connection"
* "Choose Download Sites" → any are fine.
* "Select packages." → search for sqlite.  Then, under Database, select sqlite3 so it gives a version number instead "skip".  Then "Next."


If you have great trouble with this and use Firefox, you can just install the SQLite Manager add-on:
