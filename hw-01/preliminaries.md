# Preliminaries

* You will need to have a 'Terminal' set up on your computer.  If you're running a Mac, it _is_ installed.  Just Spotlight search for 'Terminal.'  If you have a Windows machine, you'll need to install [cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html).  Since the Windows install is a bit more finnicky, you can find additional instructions [here](windows_install_instructions.md).
* Download the Python 3.5, 64-bit [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (Graphical Installer is easier), and install it on your computer.  (It may ask for your business email -- ignore it.)  When the install is complete, if you now run your Terminal and type `python`, then hit `<Enter>`, you should get a new command prompt.  It should say `Python 3.5.2 |Anaconda...`  You can test it out (`1 + 1`, then `<Enter>`) and quit (`quit()` or `ctrl+D` on a Mac).  As above -- Windows users please see the [additional instructions](windows_install_instructions.md).
  * If the installer asks whether or not it can edit your .bashrc, the answer is _yes_.
* I encourage you to use [Atom](https://atom.io/) as a text editor for your first assignment; it provides syntax highlighting that you will find useful.  The [Download](https://atom.io/) and installation should be trivial.  If you want, you can delete it when you're done.
  * Atom requires OS X 10.8 or later.  For 10.6 or 10.7, try Sublime or TextWrangler ([4.5.12](http://www.barebones.com/support/textwrangler/updates.html)).
* Finally, create a [student GitHub account](https://education.github.com/pack), or just a standard GitHub account.  You will use this account to push (submit) all of your work.  Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  * If you are running Mac OS X 10.7 or 10.8, you may need to get your git from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/p/git-osx-installer/activity/?page=0&limit=100#57cc86a334309d5c609e9fc8); search for version git-2.3.5-intel-universal-snow-leopard.dmg.  If you did the Window Cygwin setup, it should have included git.
  * You will probably have to 'create an ssh key for your account.'  This is just the way that the git encrypts communication (lets you download files); `ssh` (secure shell) is the standard way that we make secure connections from the command line.  Follow the instructions to [generate a new ssh key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) and [add it to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/).  If you have trouble creating the passphrase when the time comes ... don't (just leave it blank/hit return).  By providing the `id_rsa.pub` to GitHub, you're permanently telling it the call and response (Marco/Polo) so that it knows your computer is _you_.  This last piece is not a prerequisite for starting on Monday!
   * If `pbcopy` doesn't work, the piece that you'll paste into the GitHub site, is the output of `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
