# The Web

You can accept this assignment [here](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/66526f93dac8e6a95ed82fff64faad2b).  It is due Wednesday November 9 at 1:30am.

## Make A Simple Website

* Make a small, professional website, using and adapting the example from class.  It can be about you, a topic, or balderdash.  But it should include:

  * A picture
  * A table
  * At least three sections
  * A list (could be the nav bar)
  * A navigation bar, with links to sections

* In WEBSITE: provide a link to your website as:

  http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/harris-ippp/hw-6-userid/blob/master/my_site.html

  where the second part is just the path to your file on GitHub.  For instace, you could see the website from class like so:
  
  http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/harris-ippp/lectures/blob/master/docs/index.html
  
  Alternatively, 

* **Extra credit:** Put your webpage on a server!  Follow the instructions [here](https://answers.uchicago.edu/page.php?id=15886) to create an account on home.uchicago.edu, and upload ([Mac](https://answers.uchicago.edu/page.php?id=15895)/[PC](https://answers.uchicago.edu/page.php?id=15893)) your website.  Name it `index.html`, the name that it is the automatic resoruce loaded at home.uchicago.edu/~your_user_id/.  Put _that_ in WEBSITE.



## Elections in the Old Dominion

### The Data Source

Navigate to the [Virginia Historical Elections Database](http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/).  Click around.  What you will find is a "fairly common" mix of "standard" html with a slightly-hidden API.  The web address for Presidential elections is highly suggestive:

http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/search/year_from:1924/year_to:2015/office_id:1/stage:General

If you expand "Candidates »" for a single election and follow along to "[See Details for this Election »](http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/44930/)", you'll end up at the results for that contest, with a URL that again suggests an API:

http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/44930/

Under "Actions" on the left hand side, click on "Download this election."  Right-click on the [Municipality Results](http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/download/44930/precincts_include:0/) to get the link

http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/download/44930/precincts_include:0/

Again, it's pretty darn suggestive.  44930 is the election ID for the General Presiential Election in 2012.  Download the file.  It's a CSV!  

So for any election, we can grab the low-level voting records really easily if we know its ID!  Unfortunately, the IDs are not (as far as I can tell) neatly exposed.  But they _are_ contained in the search results.  You'll have to scrape them out.

### Your Tasks

1. Using BeautifulSoup ([docs](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)), print, then save as ELECTION_ID, a list containing the years and election IDs in exactly this format.  Save (and commit) your work in `e1.py`.
   ```
   2012 44930
   2008 39050
   2004 41055
   2000 39517
   1996 34787
   ...  ...
   ```
  <details>
  <summary>Hints, step by step.</summary>
  If you are reading this, make sure you understand the big picture, before you try to implement the steps.
  Otherwise the steps will be meaningless and confusing.
    * Search within the the source for the first election id, 44930.  It appears twice, once in a row ID and once in a link.  I think the row will be easier to use.
    * Set up your `soup` as we did in class: make the `requests.get()`, save it, and parse it.
    * Grab all of the instances where the class is `election_item`, like `soup.find_all(tag_type, class_name)`, i.e., `soup.find_all("tr", "election_item")`.
    * Extract the IDs; split them on dashes to extract the numbers.
    * Now, _within that same row_ `row.find()` the cell containing the year, using the same syntax as above.  Recall that `find()` yields the first instance, instead of the list.  What are the tag and the class, now?  
    * Grab the year using `.string` (or `.contents[0]`).
  </details>

2. Loop over your list from Part 1, and use requests to download the CSV files from.
   You will format them like so:

   ```
   http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/download/{}/precincts_include:0/
   ```

   Save your work in `e2.py` and commit your csv file for the 2012 election, naming it `2012.csv`.

   Don't run parts 1 and 2 every time you do this part -- once it's downloaded leave it be!
   We don't want to bother the Virginia Election site too much!

   <details>
   <summary>Hints</summary>
   * Loop over a file using: `for line in open("ELECTION_ID"):`.
   * You can print the contents of the response using `resp.text`.
     Instead, write them to files (see slide 8 of [lecture 3B](https://github.com/harris-ippp/lectures/raw/master/03/files.pdf)) with a meaningful name structure:
     
     ```
     file_name = year +".csv"
     with open(file_name, "w") as out:
       out.write(resp.text)
     ```
  </details>


3. Import your CSV files into a single `pandas.DataFrame()` and plot the Republican vote share in Accomack County as a fraction of Total Votes Cast.  Save your work as `e3.py` and commit your plot as `accomack.png`.

   <details>
   <summary>Hints</summary>
   * The challenge is in the `read_csv()`: there are empty columns, and the 'relevant' column names (party names) are in the second row.  So you need to import that single row as a dictionary, to change the column names.  You can do the setup, like so
     ```
     header = pd.read_csv("president_general_2004.csv", nrows = 1).dropna(axis = 1)
     d = header.iloc[0].to_dict()

     df = pd.read_csv("president_general_2004.csv", index_col = 0,
                    thousands = ",", skiprows = [1])

     df.rename(inplace = True, columns = d) # rename to democrat/republican
     df.dropna(inplace = True, axis = 1)    # drop empty columns
     df["Year"] = 2004
     ```
   * Write a for loop, saving up all of your dataframes (elections) in a list.  Then `concat' them together.  You'll probably want just these columns:
     ```
     ["Democratic", "Republican", "Total Votes Cast", "Year"]
     ```
   * Then you just need to define a new column, Republican Share, and plot that against year.
  </details>

4. Extra Credit (this week -- will be required next week): put all of this into a function (or a sript, with options!!) so that you can select the county "on the fly."
